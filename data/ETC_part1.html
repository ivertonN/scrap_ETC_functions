<b>Long ago,</b> someone drew a triangle and three segments across it. Each segment started at a vertex and stopped at the midpoint of the opposite side. The segments met in a point. The person was impressed and repeated the experiment on a different shape of triangle. Again the segments met in a point. The person drew yet a third triangle, very carefully, with the same result. He told his friends. To their surprise and delight, the coincidence worked for them, too. Word spread, and the magic of the three segments was regarded as the work of a higher power.
<p>
Centuries passed, and someone <i><b>proved</b></i> that the three medians do indeed concur in a point, now called the <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/class/centroid.html" style="font-style: italic">centroid</a>. The ancients found other points, too, now called the <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/class/incenter.html" style="font-style: italic">incenter</a>, <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/class/ccenter.html" style="font-style: italic">circumcenter</a>, and <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/class/orthocn.html" style="font-style: italic">orthocenter</a>. More centuries passed, more special points were discovered, and a definition of <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/roads.html" style="font-style: italic">triangle center</a> emerged. Like the definition of continuous function, this definition is satisfied by infinitely many objects, of which only finitely many will ever be published. The Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers (ETC) extends a list of 400 triangle centers published in the 1998 book <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/tcct.html" style= "font-style: italic">Triangle Centers and Central Triangles</a>. For subsequent developments, click Links (one of the buttons atop this page). In particular, Eric Weisstein's <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/" style= "font-weight: bold">MathWorld</a>, covers much of classical and modern triangle geometry, including sketches and references.
</p><p>
A site in which triangle centers play a central role is Bernard Gibert's <a href="https://bernard-gibert.pagesperso-orange.fr/index.html" style="font-weight: bold">Cubics in the Triangle Plane</a>.  Special points and properties of 4-sided plane figures are closely associated with triangle centers; see Chris van Tienhoven's <a href="https://chrisvantienhoven.nl/9-mathematics/encyclopedia-of-quadri-figures/3-encyclopedia-of-quadri-figures" style= "font-weight: bold">Encyclopedia of Quadri-Figures (EQF)</a>.

<h2>HOW TO USE ETC</h2>

You won't have to scroll down very far to find well known centers.  Other named centers can be found using your computer's searcher - for example, search for "Apollonius" to find "Apollonius point" as X(181).
</p><p>
To determine if a possibly new center is already listed, click <b>Tables</b> at the top of this page and scroll to "Search 6.9.13". If you're unsure of a term, click <b>Glossary</b> or Pierre Douillet's much expanded and very useful version: 
<a href="http://www.douillet.info/~douillet/triangle/Glossary.pdf"> <b>Translation of the Kimberling's Glossary into barycentrics</b></a>.
</p><p>
For visual constructions of selected centers with text, click <b>Sketches</b>. To learn about the triangle geometry interest group, Hyacinthos and other resources, or to view acknowledgments or supplementary encyclopedic material, click <b>Links</b>, <b>Thanks</b>, or <b>Tables</b>.
</p></p>
Under <b>Tables</b>, you can find <b>Search_13_6_9</b> (and two other Searches), which can be used to determine whether a newly discovered point is already in ETC.  For such a search, be sure to visit Ron Knott's <a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Triangle/tricoords.html"> <b>Triangle Convertor for Cartesian, Trilinear and Barycentric Coordinates</b></a>.
</p><p>
If you have The Geometer's Sketchpad, you can view sketches of many of the triangle centers. These are <b>dynamic</b> sketches, meaning that you can vary the shape of the reference triangle A, B, C by dragging these vertices. (For information on Sketchpad, click <a href="http://www.dynamicgeometry.com/" style="font-weight: bold">Sketchpad</a>.) The sketches are also useful for making your own Sketchpad tools, so that you can quickly construct X-of-T for many choices of X and T. For example, starting with ABC and point P, you could efficiently construct center X of the four triangles ABC, BCP, CAP, ABP.
</p><p>
The algebraic definition of triangle center (<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangleCenterFunction.html">MathWorld</a>) admits points whose <i>geometric</i> interpretation for fixed numerical sidelengths a,b,c is not "central." Roger Smyth offers this example: on the domain of scalene triangles, define f(a,b,c) = 1 for a&gt;b and a&gt;c and f(a,b,c) = 0 otherwise; then f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b) is a triangle center which picks out the vertex opposite the longest side. Such centers turn out to be useful, as, for example, when distinguishing between the Fermat point and the 1st isogonic center; see the note at X(13).
</p> 

<h3>NOTATION AND COORDINATES</h3>

<p class="auto-style2">The reference triangle is ABC, with sidelengths a,b,c. Each triangle
center P has homogeneous trilinear coordinates, or simply <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/trilin.html" style="font-weight: bold">trilinears</a>, of the form x : y : z. This means that there is a nonzero function h of (a,b,c) such that
</p><p>
x = hx', y = hy', z = hz',
<br> <p class="auto-style2">where x', y', z' denote the directed distances from P to sidelines BC, CA, AB. Likewise, u : v : w are <b>barycentrics</b> if there is a function k of (a,b,c) such that
</p><p>
u = ku', v = kv', w = kw',
<br>	<p class="auto-style2">where u', v', w' denote the signed areas of triangles PBC, PCA, PAB.  Both coordinate systems are widely used; if trilinears for a point are x : y : z, then barycentrics are ax : by : cz.
</p><p>
In order that every center should have its own name, in cases where no particular name arises from geometrical or historical considerations, the name of a star is used instead. For example, X(770) is POINT ACAMAR. For a list of star names, visit <a href="http://www.obliquity.com/skyeye/misc/name.html">SkyEye - (Un)Common Star Names</a>.

<h3>Introduced on March 21, 2015:  Shinagawa coefficients for triangle centers on the Euler line</h3>
Suppose that X is a triangle center given by barycentric coordinates f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b).  The Shinagawa coefficients of X are the functions G(a,b,c) and H(a,b,c) such that
</p> <p> 
f(a,b,c) = G(a,b,c)*S<sup>2</sup> + H(a,b,c)*S<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub>.
</p> <p> 
For many choices of X, G(a,b,c) and H(a,b,c) are conveniently expressed in terms of the following:
</p> <p> 
E = (S<sub>B</sub> + S<sub>C</sub>)(S<sub>C</sub> + S<sub>A</sub>)(S<sub>A</sub> + S<sub>B</sub>)/S<sup>2</sup>, so that E = (abc/S)<sup>2</sup> = 4R<sup>2</sup>
<br>
F = S<sub>A</sub>S<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub>/S<sup>2</sup>, so that F = (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>)/2 - 4R<sup>2</sup> = S<sub>&omega;</sub> - 4R<sup>2</sup> 
</p> <p> 
Examples:<br>
X(2) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, 0); i.e., X(2) = 1*S<sup>2</sup> + 0*S<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub><br>
X(3) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, -1)<br>
X(4) has Shinagawa coefficients (0, 1)<br>
X(5) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, 1)<br>
X(23) has Shinagawa coefficients (E + 4F, -4E - 4F)<br>
X(1113) has Shinagawa coefficients (R - |OH|, -3R + |OH|)<br>
</p> <p> 
A cyclic sum notation, $...$, is introduced here especially for use with Shinagawa coefficients.  For example, $aS<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub>$ abbreviates aS<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub> + bS<sub>C</sub>S<sub>A</sub> + cS<sub>A</sub>S<sub>B</sub>.
</p> <p> 
Example:  X(21) has Shinagawa coefficients ($aS<sub>A</sub>$, abc - $aS<sub>A</sub>$)
</p> <p> 
If a point X has Shinagawa coefficients (u,v) where u and v are real numbers (i.e, G(a,b,c) and H(a,b,c) are constants), then the segment joining X and X(2) is given by |GX| = 2v|GO|/(3u + v), where |GO| = (E - 8F)<sup>1/2</sup>/6.  Then the equation |GX| = 2v|GO|/(3u + v) can be used to obtain these combos:
</p> <p> 
X = [(u + v)/2]*X(2) - (v/3)*X(3)<br>
X = u*X(2) + (v/3)*X(4)<br>
X = u*X(3) + [(u + v)/2]*X(4).
</p> <p> 
The function F is also given by these identities: <br>
F = (4R<sup>2</sup> - 36|GO|<sup>2</sup>)/8  and  F = R<sup>2</sup>( 1 - J<sup>2</sup>)/2, where J = |OH|/R.

<h3>Introduced on November 1, 2011: Combos </h3>
<p>
Suppose that P and U are finite points having normalized barycentric coordinates (p,q,r) and (u,v,w). (Normalized means that p + q + r = 1 and u + v + w = 1.) Suppose that f = f(a,b,c) and g = g(a,b,c) are nonzero homogeneous functions having the same degree of homogeneity.  Let x = fp + gu, y = fq + gv, z = fr + gw. <b>The (f,g) combo of P and U, denoted by f*P + g*U, is introduced here as the point X = x : y : z (homogeneous barycentric coordinates);
</b>
the normalized barycentric coordinates of X are (kx,ky,kz), where k=1/(x+y+z).
</p><p>
<b>Note 1.</b> If P and U are given by normalized trilinear coordinates (instead of barycentric), then f*P + g*U has homogeneous trilinears fp+gu : fq+gv : fr+gw, which is symbolically identical to the homogenous barycentrics for f*P + g*U. The normalized trilinear coordinates for X are (hx,hy,hz), where h=2*area(ABC))/(ax + by + cz).
</p><p>
<b>Note 2.</b> The definition of combo readily extends to finite sets of finite points. In particular, the (f,g,h) combo of P = (p,q,r), U = (u,v,w), J = (j,k,m) is given by fp + gu + hj : fq + gv + hk : fr + gw + hm and denoted by f*P + g*U + h*J.
</p><p>
<b>Note 3.</b> f*P + g*U is collinear with P and U, and its {P,Q}-harmonic conjugate is fp - gu : fq - gv : fr - gw.
</p><p>
<b>Note 4.</b> Suppose that f,g,h are homogeneous symmetric functions all of the same degree of homogeneity, and suppose that X, X', X" are triangle centers. Then f*X + g*X' + h*X'' is a triangle         center.
</p><p>
<b>Note 5.</b> Suppose that X, X', X'', X''' are triangle centers and X', X'', X''' are not collinear. Then there exist f,g,h as in Note 4 such that X = f*X' + g*X'' + h*X'''.  That is, loosely speaking, every triangle center is a linear combination of any other three noncollinear triangle centers.
</p><p>
<b>Note 6.</b> Continuing from Note 5, examples of f,g,h are conveniently given using Conway symbols for a triangle ABC with sidelengths a,b,c. Conway symbols and certain classical symbols are
identified here:
</p><p>
S = 2*area(ABC)<br>
S<sub>A</sub> = (b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>)/2 = bc cos A<br>
S<sub>B</sub> = (c<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>)/2 = ca cos B<br>
S<sub>C</sub> = (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>)/2 = ab cos C<br>
S<sub>&omega;</sub> = S cot &omega;<br>
s = (a + b + c)/2<br>
s<sub>a</sub> = (b + c - a)/2<br>
s<sub>b</sub> = (c + a - b)/2<br>
s<sub>c</sub> = (a + b - c)/2<br>
r = inradius = S/(a + b + c)<br>
R = circumradius = abc/(2S)<br>
cot(&omega;) = (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>)/(2S), where &omega; is the Brocard angle
</p><p>
<b>Note 7.</b> The definition of combo along with many examples were developed by Peter Moses prior to November 1, 2011. After that combos have been further developed by Peter Moses, Randy Hutson, and Clark Kimberling.
</p><p>
Examples of two-point combos:<br><b>X(175) = 2s*X(1) - (r + 4R)*X(7)<br>X(176) = 2s*X(1) + (r + 4R)*X(7)<br>X(481) = s*X(1) - (r + 4R)*X(7)<br>X(482) = s*X(1) + (r + 4R)*X(7)
</b></p><p>
Examples of three-point combos: see below at X(1), X(2), etc.
</p><p>
<b>Note 8.</b> Suppose that T is a (central) triangle with vertices A',B',C' given by normalized barycentrics. Then T is represented by a 3x3 matrix with row sums equal to 1. Let NT denote the set of these matrices and let * denote matrix multiplication. Then NT is closed under *. Also, NT is closed under matrix inversion, so that (NT, *) is a group. Once normalized, any central T can be used to produce triangle centers as combos of the form Xcom(nT); see the preambles to X(3663) and X(3739).

Let O<sub>A</sub> be the circle tangent to side BC at its midpoint and to the circumcircle on the side of BC opposite A. Define O<sub>B</sub> and O<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let L<sub>A</sub> be the external tangent to circles O<sub>B</sub> and O<sub>C</sub> that is nearest to O<sub>A</sub>. Define L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub>         cyclically. Let A' = L<sub>B</sub> &cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and define B' and C' cyclically.

As a point on the Euler line, X(2) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, 0).
</p><p>
X(2) is the point of concurrence of the medians of ABC, situated 1/3 of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  More generally, if L is any line in the plane of ABC, then the distance from X(2) to L is the average of the distances from A, B, C to L. An idealized triangular sheet balances atop a pin head located at X(2) and also balances atop any knife-edge that passes through X(2). The triangles BXC, CXA, AXB have equal areas if and only if X = X(2).

</p><p>
X(2) is the centroid of the set of 3 vertices, the centroid of the triangle including its interior, but not the centroid of the triangle without its interior; that centroid is X(10).
</p><p>
X(2) is the identity of the group of triangle centers under "barycentric multiplication" defined by
</p>
(x : y : z)*(u : v : w) = xu : yv : zw.
<p></p>
X(2) is the unique point X (as a function of a,b,c) for which the vector-sum XA + XB + XC is the zero vector.

Let A'B'C' be the excentral triangle.  Let Oa be the A'-McCay circle of triangle A'BC, and define Ob, Oc cyclically.  X(2) is the radical center of Oa, Ob, Oc.  (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)
<p></p>
X(2) is the unique point that is the symmedian point of its antipedal triangle.  (Randy Hutson, August 19, 2019)
<p></p>
Let A'B'C' be the midheight triangle.  Let A" be the cevapoint of B' and C', and define B" and C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(2).  (Randy Hutson, October 8, 2019)

As a point on the Euler line, X(3) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, -1).

X(3) is the point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of ABC. The lengths of segments AX, BX, CX are equal if and only if X = X(3). This common distance is the radius of the circumcircle, which passes through vertices A,B,C. Called the circumradius, it is given by R = a/(2 sin A) = abc/(4*area(ABC)).
</p><p>
The tangents at vertices of excentral triangle to the McCay cubic K003 concur in X(3).  Also, the tangents at A,B,C to the orthocubic K006 concur in X(3).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of X(4).  Let A" be X(4)-of-AB'C', and define B", C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(3). (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)

Let P be a point in the plane of ABC.  Let P' be the isogonal conjugate of P.  Let P" be the pedal antipodal perspector of P.  X(3) is the unique point P for which P' = P". (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)
</p><p>
Taking a reference triangle ABC and a variable point P on the plane, P=X(3) is the point of maximal area of its pedal triangle when considering all points P inside the circumcircle of ABC. There are points P far away from the circumcircle for which the area of their pedal triangles is much larger. However, if you consider the signed area of the pedal triangle of P (of which sign depends on whether the points are in clockwise or anti-clockwise order), you could just say that the area of the pedal triangle of P is always negative whenever P is outside of the circumcircle so that P=X(3) gives the global maximum. (Mark Helman, July 10, 2020)
</p><p>
A slightly similar thing happens regarding the area of the antipedal triangle of P. P=X(4) has the smallest area of its antipedal amongst all P in the interior of triangle ABC (when X(4) is in this interior). There are points P (on the circumcircle) for which this area goes to 0. However, if we consider the signed area of the antipedal, even though there are still regions of the plane outside of ABC where the signed area is positive, P=X(4) gives the smallest area of the antipedal among all P for which this area is positive (this works even when ABC is obtuse, and points close to the circumcircle (on both sides) have negative antipedal area).

The tangents at A,B,C to the McCay cubic K003 concur in X(4).  Also, the tangents at A,B,C to the Lucas cubic K007 concur in X(4). (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let P be a point in the plane of ABC.  Let Oa be the circumcenter of BCP, and define Ob and Oc cyclically.  Let Q be the circumcenter of OaObOc.  P = Q only when P = X(4). (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)
</p><p>
Taking a reference triangle ABC and a variable point P on the plane, P=X(3) is the point of maximal area of its pedal triangle when considering all points P inside the circumcircle of ABC. There are points P far away from the circumcircle for which the area of their pedal triangles is much larger. However, if you consider the signed area of the pedal triangle of P (of which sign depends on whether the points are in clockwise or anti-clockwise order), you could just say that the area of the pedal triangle of P is always negative whenever P is outside of the circumcircle so that P=X(3) gives the global maximum. (Mark Helman, July 10, 2020)
</p><p>
A slightly similar thing happens regarding the area of the antipedal triangle of P. P=X(4) has the smallest area of its antipedal amongst all P in the interior of triangle ABC (when X(4) is in this interior). There are points P (on the circumcircle) for which this area goes to 0. However, if we consider the signed area of the antipedal, even though there are still regions of the plane outside of ABC where the signed area is positive, P=X(4) gives the smallest area of the antipedal among all P for which this area is positive (this works even when ABC is obtuse, and points close to the circumcircle (on both sides) have negative antipedal area).

X(4) and the vertices A,B,C comprise an orthocentric system, defined as a set of four points, one of which is the orthocenter of the         triangle of the other three (so that each is the orthocenter of the other three). The incenter and excenters also form an orthocentric         system. If ABC is acute, then X(4) is the incenter of the orthic triangle.
</p><p>
Suppose P is not on a sideline of ABC. Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of P. Let D,E,F be the circles having diameters AA', BB',CC'.        The radical center of D,E,F is X(4). (Floor van Lamoen, Hyacinthos #214, Jan. 24, 2000.)

Let A2B2C2 be the 2nd Conway triangle.  Let A' be the crosspoint of B2 and C2, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(4).  (Randy Hutson, December 10, 2016)

X(5) is the center of the nine-point circle. Euler showed in that
        this circle passes through the midpoints of the sides of ABC and the
        feet of the altitudes of ABC, hence six of the nine points. The other
        three are the midpoints of segments A-to-X(4), B-to-X(4), C-to-X(4).
        The radius of the nine-point circle is one-half the circumradius.</p>

Let A'B'C' be the points in which the A-excircle meets BC, the B-excircle meets CA, and the C-excircle meets AB, respectively. The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(8). Another construction of A' is to start at A and trace around ABC half its perimeter, and similarly for B' and C'. Also, X(8) is the incenter of the anticomplementary triangle.

Let E be the locus of the trilinear pole of a line that passes through X(1).  The center of E is X(9).  Moreover, E passes through the points X(100), X(658), X(662), X(799), X(1821), X(2580), X(2581) and the bicentric pairs PU(34), PU(75), PU(77), PU(79).  Also, E is a circumellipse of ABC and an inellipse of the excentral triangle.  (Randy Hutson, February 10, 2016)

Let E be the circumellipse of T = ABC with center X(9).  Then ABC is a billiard orbit of E (3-periodic). If we fix E in the plane, all its triangular orbits (a set of "rotating" triangles T) have the same X(9). Note that X(9) is the point of concurrence of lines drawn from each excenter to the midpoint of the corresponding side of T.

Notes from Peter Moses (July 1, 2019) about the circumellipse E with center X(9):
<br>
E passes through the vertices of these triangles: ABC; Honsberger (see X(7670); Inner Conway (see X(11677); Gemini 2, Gemini 30.
<br>
E passes through the point X(i) for these i:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 88, 100, 162, 190, 651, 653, 655, 658, 660, 662, 673, 771, 799,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 823, 897, 1156, 1492, 1821, 2349, 2580, 2581, 3257, 4598, 4599<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4604, 4606, 4607, 8052, 20332, 23707, 24624, 27834, 32680. 
<br>
The perspector of E is X(1); the major axis of E passes through X(i) for these i: 9, 2590, 3307, 24646, and the minor axis, for these i: 9, 2591, 3309, 24647.  The ellipse E is the isogonal conjugate of the antiorthic axis.
<br>
Let  g = length of semi-major axis of E; then g = Sqrt[(2 R (r + R + Sqrt[R(R - 2 r)]) s^2)/(r + 4 R)^2]. 
<br>
Let h = length of semi-minor axis of E: then h = Sqrt[(2 R (r + R - Sqrt[R(R - 2 r)]) s^2)/(r + 4 R)^2]. 
<br>
h/g = Sqrt[(OI - R) (OI + 3 R) / ((OI - 3 R) (OI + R))] = Sqrt[(r + R - Sqrt[R (R - 2 r)]) / (r + R + Sqrt[R (R - 2 r)])].
<br>
eccentricity of E: 2 Sqrt[OI R / ((3 R - OI) (OI + R))].
<br>
If F is a focus of E, then |FX(9)|^2 = 4 s^2 R Sqrt[R (R - 2 r)] / (r + 4 R)^2/.
<br>
The axes of E are the asymptotes of the Feuerbach hyperbola.
<br>
The area of E is &pi; R S /(r (r + 4 R))^(3/2) = 4 &pi; a b c / ( 2 b c + 2 c a + 2 a b - a^2 - b^2 - c^2 )^(3/2) * area(ABC). 
<br>
The triangle tangent to the vertices of E is the excentral triangle.
</p><p>
Let A'B'C' be the intouch triangle of the anticomplementary triangle of ABC. The ellipse E passes through A', B', C'.

The circumellipse with center X(9) meets the circumhyperbola with center X(11) (i.e., the Feuerbach hyperbola) in X(1156). (Dan Reznik, January 20, 2020.)
</p><p>
Each of the following cubics passes through the four foci (two real and two imaginary) of the ellipse E: K040, K351, K352, K710, K716, K1060.  The two real foci are a pair of isogonal conjugates, and likewise for the two imaginary foci.  Moreover, if p : q : r is on the circumcircle, then p/a : q/b : r/c is on E.  (Peter Moses, July 2 and 3, 2019)
</p><p>
The ellipse E is the isogonal conjugate of the antiorthic axis, X(44)X(513), with barycentric equation x + y + z = 0, and E is the isotomic conjugate of the X(514)X(661), with barycentric equation a x + b y + c z = 0.  This line, denoted by L(31), is the perspectrix of the anticomplementary triangle and the inner Conway triangle (which is the intouch triangle of the anticomplementary triangle). Points lying on X(514)X(661) include X(i) for i = 514, 661, 693, 857, 908, 914, 1577, 1959, 2084, 2582, 2583, 3239, 3250, 3762, 3766, 3835, 3904, 3912, 3936, 3948, 4129, 4358, 4391, 4462, 4468, 4486, 4728, 4766, 4776, 4789, 4791, 4801, 4823, 4978, 5074, 5179, 6332, 6381, 6590, 8045, 14206, 14207, 14208, 14209, 14210, 14281, 14349, 14350, 14963, 18669, 18715, 24018, 30565, 30566, 30804, 30806, 32679.

Construct the equilateral triangle BA'C having base BC and vertex A' on the negative side of BC; similarly construct equilateral triangles CB'A and AC'B based on the other two sides. The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(13). If each of the angles A, B, C is &lt; 2&pi;/3, then X(13) is the only center X for which the angles BXC, CXA, AXB are equal, and X(13) minimizes the sum |AX| + |BX| + |CX|. The antipedal triangle of X(13) is equilateral.
</p><p>
If, however, A&gt; 2&pi;/3, then the Fermat point, defined geometrically as the minimizer of |AX| + |BX| + |CX|, is not the 1st isogonic center (which is defined by the above trilinears). Trilinears for the Fermat point when A&gt; 2&pi;/3 are simply 1:0:0. To represent the Fermat point in the form f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), one must  use Boolean variables, as shown at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_point">Fermat point.</a>

Let U and V be the points on sideline BC met by the interior and exterior bisectors of angle A. The circle having diameter UV is the A-Apollonian circle. The B- and C- Apollonian circles are similarly         constructed. Each circle passes through one vertex and both isodynamic points. (This configuration, based on the cevians of X(1), generalizes to arbitrary cevians; see TCCT, p. 98, problem 8.)

Let La be the polar of X(4) wrt the circle centered at A and passing through X(3), and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  (Note: X(4) is the perspector of any circle centered at a vertex of ABC.)  Let A" = Lb&cap;\Lc, and define B" and C" cyclically.  Triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to the anticomplementary triangle, and the center of homothety is X(20), which is also the orthocenter of A"B"C".  Also, let La be the line through the intersections of the B- and C-Soddy ellipses, and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Then La,Lb,Lc concur in X(20).  Also, let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of X(253).  Let A" be the orthocenter of AB'C', and define B" and C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(20).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let A' be the center of the conic through the contact points of the incircle and the A-excircle with the sidelines of ABC.  Define B' and C' cyclically.  Let A" be the center of the conic through the contact points of the B- and C- excircles with the sidelines of ABC.  Define B" and C" cyclically.  Let A* be the midpoint of A' and A", and define B* and C* cyclically.  The triangle A*B*C* is perspective to ABC at X(25).  See also X(6), X(218), X(222), X(940), X(1743).

Let A' be the radical center of the nine-point circle and the B- and C-power circles.  efine B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C' is homothetic with the orthic triangle, and the center of homothety is X(25).  Also X(25) is the point of intersection of these two lines: isotomic conjugate of polar conjugate of van Aubel line (i.e., line X(2)X(3)), and polar conjugate of isotomic conjugate of van Aubel line (i.e., line X(25)X(393)).  Also, X(25) is the trilinear pole of line X(512)X(1692), this line being the isogonal conjugate of the isotomic conjugate of the orthic axis; the line X(512)X(1692) is also the polar of X(76) wrt polar circle, and the line is also the radical axis of circumcircle and 2nd Lemoine circle.

Let A'B'C' be the orthic triangle.  Let A" be the barycentric product of the (real or imaginary) circumcircle intercepts of line B'C'.  Define B", C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(25).  (Randy Hutson, October 27, 2015)

The 2nd Ehrmann triangle, defined in the preamble to X(8537), can be generalized as follows.  Let P be a point in the plane of ABC and not on BC&cup;CA&cup;AB.  Let Ab the the point of intersection of the circle {{P,B,C}} and the line AB, and define Bc and Ca cyclically.  Define Ac symmetrically, and define Ba and Cb cyclically.  Let A' = BcBa&cap;CaCb, and define B' and C' cyclically.  Triangle A'B'C', here introduced as the <b>P-Ehrmann triangle</b>, is homothetic to the orthic triangle.  The X(1)-Ehrmann triangle is the intangents triangle, and the X(6)-Ehrmann triangle is the 2nd Ehrmann triangle.  If P lies on the circumcircle, the P-Ehrmann triangle is the tangential triangle.  If P is on the Brocard 2nd cubic K018 or the circumcircle, then the P-Ehrmann triangle is perspective to ABC.  The homothetic center of the orthic triangle and the X(4)-Ehrmann triangle is X(25).

Let P be a point in the plane of triangle ABC, not on a sideline of ABC.  Let A1 be the isogonal conjugate of A with respect to triangle BCP, and define B1, C1 cyclically.  Call triangle A1B1C1 the 1st isogonal triangle of P.  A1B1C1 is also the reflection triangle of the isogonal conjugate of P.  A1B1C1 is perspective to ABC iff P lies on the Neuberg cubic.  The perspector lies on cubic K060 (pK(X1989, X265), O(X5) orthopivotal cubic).  Let A2 be the isogonal conjugate of A1 with respect to triangle B1C1P, and define B2, C2 cyclically.  Call triangle A2B2C2 the 2nd isogonal triangle of P.  Continuing, let An be the isogonal conjugate of A(n-1) with respect to triangle B(n-1)C(n-1)P, and define B(n), C(n) cyclically.  Call triangle AnBnCn the nth isogonal triangle of P.  For n >= 2, all triangles AnBnCn are perspective to A(n-1)B(n-1)C(n-1).  Call the perspector, Pn, the nth isogonal perspector of P.  Pn is the orthocenter of A(n-1)B(n-1)C(n-1) and either the incenter or an excenter of AnBnCn.  The triangles AnBnCn are all concyclic, with P as center.  Call the circle the isogonal circle of P.  For P = X(1), the 2nd isogonal triangle of X(1) is homothetic to ABC at X(36); see also X(35), X(1478), X(1479), X(3583), X(3585), X(5903), X(7741), X(7951).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of X(1). Let A" be the centroid of
        triangle AB'C', and define B" and C" cyclically. Then the lines AA",
        BB", CC" concur in X(37). (Eric Danneels, Hyacinthos 7892, 9/13/03)
</p><p>
A simple construction of X(37) as a crosspoint can be generalized as
        follows: let DEF be the medial triangle of ABC and let A'B'C' be the
        cevian triangle of a point U other than the centroid, X(2). The
        crosspoint of X(2) and U is then the point of concurrence of lines
        LD,ME,NF, where L,M,N are the respective midpoints of AA', BB', CC'. If
        U=u : v : w (trilinears), then crosspoint(X(2),U) = b/w+c/v : c/u+a/w :
        a/v+b/u, assuming that uvw is nonzero. In particular, if U=X(1), then
        the crosspoint is X(37). (Seiichi Kirikami, July 10, 2011)

Suppose that P and Q are distinct points in the plane of a triangle ABC .  Let P<sub>A</sub> = reflection of P in line AQ, let Q<sub>A</sub> = reflection of Q in line AP, and let M<sub>A</sub> = midpoint of segment P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>.  Define M<sub>B</sub> and M<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  César Lozada found that if Q = isogonal conjugate of P, then the locus of P for which M<sub>A</sub>M<sub>B</sub>M<sub>C</sub> is perspective to ABC is the union of a cubic and 6 circles:  specifically, the McCay cubic (K003), the circles {{B,C,B',C'}}, {{C,A,C',A'}}, {{A,B,A',B'}}, and the circles {{B,C,A'}}, {{C,A,B'}}, {{A,B,C'}}, where A',B',C' are the excenters of ABC.  Moreover, if P = X(3) and Q = X(4), then M<sub>A</sub>M<sub>B</sub>M<sub>C</sub> is not only perspective, but homothetic, to ABC, and the center of homothety is X(49).

Let A' be the intersection, other than A, of the circumcircle and the branch of the Lucas cubic that contains A, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C' is here introduced as the Lucas triangle (not to be confused with the Lucas central triangle).  The vertices A', B', C' lie on the rectangular hyperbola {{X(2),X(20),X(54),X(69),X(110),X(2574),X(2575),X(2979)}}.  (See https://bernard-gibert.pagesperso-orange.fr/Exemples/k007.html.)  Also, X(95) is the trilinear product of the vertices of the Lucas triangle.  (Randy Hutson, August 19, 2015)

If the line X(1)X(4) is reflected in every side of triangle ABC, then the reflections concur in X(109). (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)
</p><p>
Let P be a point on line X(1)X(4) other than X(4).  Let A' be the reflection of P in BC, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The circumcircles of CA'B', BC'A', and CA'B' concur in X(109).  (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2011)
</p><p>
Let Q be a point on line X(2)X(7) other than X(2).  Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of Q.  Let A" be the {B,C}-harmonic conjugate of A' (or equivalently, A" = BC&cap;B'C'), and define B" and C" cyclically.  The circumcircles of AB"C", BC"A", CA"B" concur in X(109).  (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2011)
</p><p>
Let A', B', C' be the Fuhrmann triangle.  The circumcircles of AB'C', BC'A', CA'B' concur in X(109).  (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2011)
</p><p>
Let A', B', C' be the intersections of the Gergonne line and lines BC, CA, AB, respectively.  The circumcircles of AB'C', BC'A', CA'B' concur in X(109).  (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2011)
</p><p>
Let P and Q be the points where the line tangent to the incircle at X(11) intersects the circumcircle.  Let L(P) be the line through P, other than PQ, that is tangent to the incircle; let L(Q) be the line through Q, other than PQ, that is tangent to the incircle.  Then X(109) = L(P)&cap;L(Q).

SH is the bianticevian conic of X(1) and X(6) and the antipedal-anticevian conic of X(3).  SH is the tangential isogonal conjugate of the Euler line, the tangential isotomic conjugate of the van Aubel line, the excentral isogonal conjugate of line X(30)X(40), and the excentral isotomic conjugate of line X(191)X(2938).  SH is tangent to the Euler line at X(3) and meets the line at infinity (and the Jerabek hyperbola, other than at X(3) and X(6)) at X(2574) and X(2575).  SH is the locus of a point P for which the P-Brocard triangle is perspective to ABC.  (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011, 1/29/2015)

Seven constructions from Randy Hutson, January 29, 2015: 
</p><p> 
(1)  Let P be a point, other than X(4), on Euler line.  Let A' be the reflection of P in BC, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The circumcircles of AA'B', BC'A', and CA'B' concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(2)  Let Q be a point on line X(2)X(6) other than X(2).  Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of Q.  Let A" be the {B,C}-harmonic conjugate of A' (or equivalently, A" = BC&cap;B'C'), and define B", C" cyclically.  The circumcircles of AB"C", BC"A", CA"B" concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(3)  Let La, Lb, Lc be the lines through A, B, C, resp. parallel to the Euler line.  Let Ma, Mb, Mc be the reflections of BC, CA, AB in La, Lb, Lc, resp. Let A' = Mb&cap;Mc, and define B', C' cyclically.  Triangle A'B'C' is inversely similar to, and 3 times the size of, ABC.  Let A"B"C" be the reflection of A'B'C' in the Euler line.  The triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, with center of homothety X(125) and centroid X(110).  (See Hyacinthos #16741/16782, Sep 2008.)
</p><p>
(4)  Let A', B', C' be the intersections of the Lemoine axis and lines BC, CA, AB, resp.  The circumcircles of AB'C', BC'A', CA'B' concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(5)  Let A', B', C' be the intersections of line X(36)X(238) and lines BC, CA, AB, resp.  The circumcircles of AB'C', BC'A', CA'B' concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(6)  Let A', B', C' be the intersections of the Euler line and lines BC, CA, AB, resp.  Let Oa, Ob, Oc be the circumcenters of AB'C', BC'A', CA'B', resp.  The lines AOa, BOb, COc concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(7)  Let Na be the reflection of X(5) in the perpendicular bisector of BC, and define Nb, Nc cyclically.  X(110) = X(2070) of NaNbNc.
</p><p>
Let A2B2C2 and A3B3C3 be the 2nd and 3rd Parry triangles.  Let A' be the barycentric product A2*A3, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(110).  (Randy Hutson, February 10, 2016)
</p><p>
Let A'B'C' be the triangle described in ADGEOM #2697 (8/26/2015, Tran Quang Hung). A'B'C' is homothetic to the anticomplementary triangle at X(110).  The nine-point circle of A'B'C' touches the circumcircle of ABC at X(110).  Also, X(110) = X(125)-of-A'B'C'.  (Randy Hutson, Novermber 2, 2016)
</p><p>
X(110): Let A' be the trilinear pole of the perpendicular bisector of BC, and define B', C' cyclically.  A'B'C' is homothetic to the circumanticevian triangle of X(4) at X(110).  X(110) is also the barycentric product A'*B'*C'. (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2018)

The circumcircle of the incentral triangle intersects the nine-point circle at 2 points, X(11) and X(115), and X(115) lies on the incentral circle and the cevian circle of every point on the Kiepert hyperbola.  Let A'B'C' be the orthic triangle.  The Brocard axes of AB'C', BC'A', CA'B' concur in X(115).  Let P be a point on the Brocard circle, and let L be the line tangent to the Brocard circle at P.  Let P' be the trilinear pole of L, and let P" be the isotomic conjugate of P'.  As P varies, P" traces an ellipse with center at X(115).  (Randy Hutson, July 23, 2015)

X(125) is the pole of the Fermat axis with respect to the Dao-Moses-Telv circle.  (Randy Hutson, December 14, 2014)

Let La, Lb, Lc be the lines through A, B, C, resp. parallel to the Euler line.  Let Ma, Mb, Mc be the reflections of BC, CA, AB in La, Lb, Lc, resp.  Let A' = Mb&cap;Mc, and define B', C' cyclically.  Triangle A'B'C' is inversely similar to, and 3 times the size of, ABC.  Let A"B"C" be the reflection of A'B'C' in the Euler line.  The triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, with center of homothety X(125); see Hyacinthos #16741/16782, Sep 2008.  (Randy Hutson, March 25, 2016)

Let A' be the midpoint between A and X(3), and define B' and C' cyclically; the triangle A'B'C' is homothetic to the medial triangle, and the center of homothety is X(140). Let A'' be the centroid of the triangle BCX(3), and define B'' and C'' cyclically; then A''B''C'' is homothetic to ABC, and the center of homothety is X(140). Also, X(140) is the center of the conic consisting of the centers of all the conics which pass through A, B, C, and X(3). (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)
This conic is also the locus of crosssums of the intersections of the circumcircle and lines through X(4).  Furthmore, this conic is the bicevian conic of X(2) and X(3).  (Randy Hutson, 9/14/2016)

Let Oa be the circle centered at A and passing through the A-vertex of the Euler triangle; define Ob and Oc cyclically.  The radical center of Oa, Ob, Oc is X(140).  (Randy Hutson, September 14, 2016)
</p><p>
Let Oa be the circle centered at A with radius 1/2*sqrt(b^2 + c^2), and define Ob and Oc cyclically.  The radical center of Oa, Ob, Oc is X(140).  (Randy Hutson, September 14, 2016)

Let (A) be the pedal circle of A wrt the tangential triangle, and define (B), (C) cyclically.  The radical center of (A), (B), (C) = X(155).  (Randy Hutson, December 10, 2016)

X(155) = X(4)-of-tangential-triangle. This point is also the center of the circle which cuts (extended) lines BC, CA, AB in pairs of points A' and A", B' and B", C' and C", respectively, such that angles A'AA", B'BB", C'CC" are all right angles. This is the <b>Dou circle,</b> described in <b>Jordi Dou,</b> Problem 1140, <i>Crux Mathematicorum,</i> 28 (2002) 461-462.

The line A'B'C' meets the line at infinity at the isogonal conjugate of X(3659).   Alternately, let A" be the trilinear pole of line La, and define B" and C" cyclically.

Let A'B'C' be the excentral triangle.  X(174) is the trilinear pole of the Monge line of the incircles of BCA', CAB', ABC'.  (Randy Hutson, December 10, 2016)
<p></p>
In notes dated 1987, Yff raises this question concerning certain triangles lying within ABC: can isoscelizers (defined at X(173)), P<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>C</sub>, P<sub>C</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>, P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>B</sub>, be constructed so that, on putting
</p><p>
R<sub>A</sub> = P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>B</sub>&cap;P<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>C</sub>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R<sub>B</sub> = P<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>C</sub>&cap;P<sub>C</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R<sub>C</sub> = P<sub>C</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>&cap;P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>B</sub>,
</p>	<p>
the following four triangles are congruent:
</p>	<p>
P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>R<sub>A</sub>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>B</sub>R<sub>B</sub>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
P<sub>C</sub>Q<sub>C</sub>R<sub>C</sub>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R<sub>A</sub>R<sub>B</sub>R<sub>C</sub> ?
</p>	<p>
After proving that the answer is yes, Yff moves the three isoscelizers in such a way that the three outer triangles, stay congruent and the inner triangle (called the Yff central triangle), R<sub>A</sub>R<sub>B</sub>R<sub>C</sub>, shrinks to X(174).
</p>	<p>
Let D be the point on side BC such that (angle BID) = (angle DIC), and likewise for point E on side CA and point F on side AB. The lines AD, BE, CF concur in X(174).  (Seiichi Kirikami, Jan. 29, 2010)
</p>	<p>
Generalization: if I is replaced by an arbitrary point P = p : q : r (trilinears), then the lines AD, BE, CF concur in the point K(P) = f(p,q,r,A) : f(q,r,p,B) : f(r,p,q,C), where f(p,q,r,A) = (q<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2</sup> + 2qr cos A)<sup>-1/2</sup>. Moreover, if P* is the inverse of P in the circumcircle, then K(P*) = K(P). (Peter Moses, Feb. 1, 2010, based on Seiichi Kirikami's construction of X(174))

The points X(175) and X(176) are discussed in an 1890 article by Emile Lemoine, accessible at 
<a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201173h">Gallica</a>. The article begins on page 111, and the two points are considered beginning on page 128.
</p><p>
A point X is defined as an isoperimetric point of triangle ABC if |XB| + |XC| + |BC| = |XC| + |XA| + |CA| = |XA| + |XB| + |AB|. Veldkamp established that X = X(175), uniquely, for some triangles ABC, but the conditions he gives are not correct. Hajja and Yff proved that the condition tan(A/2) + tan(B/2) + tan(C/2) &lt; 2 is necessary and sufficient. See also X(176) and the 1st and 2nd Eppstein points, X(481), X(482).
</p><p>
In unpublished notes, Yff proved that X(175) is the center of the outer Soddy circle. His proof later appeared in the paper by Hajja and         Yff cited below.

Every point on the Soddy line has barycentric coordinates of the form a + k/sa : b + k/sb : c + k/sc, where k is a symmetric function in         a,b,c, and sa=(b+c-a)/2, sb=(c+a-b)/2, sc=(a+b-c)/2. Writing S for 4*area(ABC):
</p><p>
X(175) = 2a - S/sa : 2b - S/sb : 2c - S/sc<br>
X(176) = 2a + S/sa : 2b + S/sb : 2c + S/sc<br>
X(481) = a - S/sa : b - S/sb : c - S/sc<br>
X(482) = a + S/sa : b + S/sb : c + S/sc<br>
X(1371) = a + 2S/(3 sa) : b + 2S/(3 sb) : c + 2S/(3 sc)<br>
X(1372) = a - 2S/(3 sa) : b - 2S/(3 sb) : c - 2S/(3 sc)<br>
X(1373) = a + 2S/sa : b + 2S/sb : c + 2S/sc<br>
X(1374) = a - 2S/sa : b - 2S/sb : c - 2S/sc<br>

There are exactly two points P such that the incircles of the triangles PBC, PCA, PAB are pairwise tangent to one another; the two         points are X(175) and X(176). There are exactly two points P such that the radical center of the incircles of PBC, PCA, PAB is P; the two points are X(175) and X(176). (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)

The points X(175) and X(176) are discussed in an 1890 article by Emile Lemoine, accessible at <a href= "http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201173h">Gallica</a>. The article begins on page 111, and the two points are considered beginning on page 128.
</p><p>
The following construction was found by Elkies: call two circles within ABC <i>companion circles</i> if they are the incircles of two         triangles formed by dividing ABC into two smaller triangles by passing a line through one of the vertices and some point on the opposite side; chain of circles O(1), O(2), ... such that O(n),O(n+1) are companion incircles for every n consists of at most six distinct circles; there is a unique chain consisting of only three distinct circles; and for this chain, the three subdividing lines concur in X(176).
</p><p>
A point X is defined as a point of equal detour of triangle ABC if |XB| + |XC| - |BC| = |XC| + |XA| - |CA| = |XA| + |XB| - |AB|. Veldkamp established that X = X(176) for some triangles ABC, but the conditions he gives are not correct. Hajja and Yff proved that the condition tan(A/2) + tan(B/2) + tan(C/2) &lt; 2 is necessary and sufficient for the existence of exactly two points of equal detour and that the condition tan(A/2) + tan(B/2) + tan(C/2) = 2 is necessary and sufficient for the existence of exactly one point of equal detour. Yff found that X(176) is also is the center of the inner Soddy circle. See also X(175) and the 1st and 2nd Eppstein points, X(481), X(482).

There are exactly two points P such that the incircles of the triangles PBC, PCA, PAB are pairwise tangent to one another; the two         points are X(175) and X(176). There are exactly two points P such that the radical center of the incircles of PBC, PCA, PAB is P; the two points are X(175) and X(176). For a point Q, let A' be the incenter of triangle BCQ, and define B' and C' cyclically; then X(176) is the only point Q such that Q is the incenter of A'B'C'. (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)

The famous Malfatti Problem is to construct three circles O(A), O(B), O(C) inside ABC such that each is externally tangent to the other two, O(A) is tangent to lines AB and AC, O(B) is tangent to BC and BA, and O(C) is tangent to CA and CB. Let A' = O(B)&cap;O(C), B' = O(C)&cap;O(A), C' = O(A)&cap;O(B). The lines AA',BB',CC' concur in X(179). Trilinears are found in Yff's unpublished notes.

X(184) is the homothetic center of triangles ABC and A'B'C', the
        latter defined as follows: let B<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>1</sub> be the
        points where the perpendicular bisector BC meets sidelines CA and AB,
        and cyclically define C<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>; A<sub>3</sub>,
        B<sub>3</sub>. Then A'B'C' is formed by the perpendicular bisectors of
        segments B<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>,
        A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>. (Fred Lang, Hyacinthos #1190)
</p>	<p>
X(184) is the subject of Hyacinthos messages 5423-5441 (May, 2002).
        In #5423, Alexei Myakishev notes that X(184) serves as a common vertex
        of three triangles inside ABC, mutually congruent and similar to ABC.
        (The triangles can be labeled XB<sub>C</sub>C<sub>B</sub>,
        XC<sub>A</sub>A<sub>C</sub>, XA<sub>B</sub>B<sub>A</sub>, with
        B<sub>C</sub> and C<sub>B</sub> on side BC, C<sub>A</sub> and
        A<sub>C</sub> on side CA, and A<sub>B</sub> and B<sub>A</sub> on side
        AB.) See 	<p style="font-weight: bold">Alexei Myakishev, <a href=

        <p>In #5435, Paul Yiu cites Fred Lang's construction of X(184) and
        notes that the three triangles are then easily constructed from X(184).
        The triangles determine three other triangles with common vertex
        X(184); in #5437, Nikos Dergiades notes that the vertex angles of these
        are 4A - &pi;, 4B - &pi;, 4C - &pi;, and that
</p><p>
if ABC is acute, then X(184) = X(63)-of-the-orthic-triangle = X(226)-of-the-tangential-triangle<br>
X(184) = homothetic center of the orthic triangle and the medial triangle of the tangential triangle.

Randy Hutson notes that X(184) is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle and sine-triple-angle circle.  (December 14, 2014)
</p><p>
Let A'B'C' be the intersections, other than X(3), of the X(3)-cevians and the Brocard circle.  Let A"B"C" be the intersections, other than X(6), of the X(6)-cevians and the Brocard circle.  Then A'B'C' and A"B"C" are perspective at X(184).  Also, X(184) = U&cap;V, where U = isotomic conjugate of polar conjugate of Brocard axis (i.e., line X(3)X(49)), and V = polar conjugate of isotomic conjugate of Brocard axis (i.e., line X(6)X(25)).  Let DEF be the orthic triangle.  Let D' be the isotomic conjugate of X(4) wrt AEF, and define E' and F' cyclically; then the lines AD', BE', CF' concur in X(184).  (Randy Hutson, June 1, 2015)

Let A' be the homothetic center of ABC and the orthic triangle of the A-extouch triangle and define B' and C' cyclically.  Triangle A'B'C' is perspective to the 3rd extouch triangle at X(223).  (Randy Hutson, September 14, 2016)

Let V<sub>a</sub>, V<sub>b</sub>, V<sub>c</sub> be the antipodes of V=X(40) in the circles (VBC), (VCA), (VAB), respectively. The triangle V<sub>a</sub>V<sub>b</sub>V<sub>c</sub> is here named the <b>Bevan antipodal triangle</b> (Hyacinthos #29638; however, see next note). The point X(223) is the unique finite fixed point of the affine transformation that maps the reference triangle ABC onto V<sub>a</sub>V<sub>b</sub>V<sub>c</sub>.  (Angel Montesdeoca, October 15, 2019)
</p><p>
The construction of the triangle VaVbVc can be generalized for an arbitrary point P (instead of V=X(40)), and is, in fact, the antipedal triangle of P (Randy Hutson, message in Anopolis Group). Thus, "Bevan antipodal triangle" = antipedal triangle of X(40). (Angel Montesdeoca, October 16, 2019)

Five constructions by Randy Hutson, January 29, 2015:
</p><p>
(1)  Let A'B'C' be the tangential triangle.  Let A" be the pole, wrt the polar circle, of line B'C', and define B", C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(264).
</p><p>
(2)  Let A'B'C' be the symmedial triangle.  Let A" be the pole, wrt the polar circle, of line B'C', and define B", C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(264).
</p><p>
(3)  Let A'B'C' be the circumsymmedial triangle.  Let A" be the pole, wrt the polar circle, of line B'C', and define B", C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(264).
</p><p>
(4)  Let A'B'C' be the Lucas(t) central triangle (for any t).  Let A" be the pole, wrt the polar circle, of line B'C', and define B", C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(264).
</p><p>
(5)  X(264) is the trilinear pole of the line X(297)X(525).  This line is the isotomic conjugate of the MacBeath circumconic, which is the isogonal conjugate of the orthic axis.  The line is also the polar of X(6) wrt the polar circle, and the radical axis of the polar and orthosymmedial circles, and the polar conjugate of the circumcircle)

x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> + yz(D + 1/D) + zx(E + 1/E) + xy(F + 1/F) = 0, where D = cos A - sin A cot rA, E = cos B - sin B cot rB, F = cos C - sin C cot rC.
</p><p>
The Hofstadter ellipse E(1/2), given by x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> - 2yz - 2xz - 2xy = 0, has center X(37) and passes through X(i)  for these i: 244, 678, 2310, 2632, 2638, 2643, 3248, 4094, 4117, 10501, 23063, 24012.

The Hofstadter ellipse E(1/2) is also the incentral inellipse, centered at X(37), and touching ABC at the traces of X(1).  The ellipse also passes through X(4094), and is the incentral isotomic conjugate of line X(512)X(4895).  (Randy Hutson, October 15, 2018)

This point is obtained as a limit of perspectors. Let r denote a real number, but not 0 or 1. Using vertex B as a pivot, swing line BC toward vertex A through angle rB and swing line BC about C through angle rC. Let A(r) be the point in which the two swung lines meet.  Obtain B(r) and C(r) cyclically. Triangle A(r)B(r)C(r) is the <i>r-Hofstadter triangle</i>; its perspector with ABC, called the Hofstadter r point, is the point given by trilinears

(sin rA)/sin(A - rA) : (sin rB)/sin(B - rB) : (sin rC)/sin(C - rC).
</p><p>
The limit of this point as r approaches 0 is X(360). The two Hofstadter points, X(359) and X(360) are examples of transcendental triangle centers, since they have no trilinear or barycentric representation using only algebraic functions of a,b,c (or sin A, sin B, sin C).

X(363) is the homothetic center of the excentral triangle and the
        inner Hutson triangle. A construction of the latter follows. The
        internal bisector of angle A meets the A-excircle in two points. Let
        P<sub>A</sub> be the point closer to line BC and let Q<sub>A</sub> be
        the other point. Define P<sub>B</sub> and P<sub>C</sub> cyclically, and
        define Q<sub>B</sub> and Q<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let L<sub>A</sub> be
        the line tangent to the A-excircle at P<sub>A</sub>, and define
        L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let M<sub>A</sub> be the
        line tangent to the A-excircle at Q<sub>A</sub>, and define
        M<sub>B</sub> and M<sub>C</sub> cyclically. The inner Hutson triangle
        is the triangle A'B'C' given by A' = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>,
        B' = L<sub>C</sub>&cap;L<sub>A</sub>, C' =
        L<sub>A</sub>&cap;L<sub>B</sub>; the outer Hutson triangle is given by
        A'' = M<sub>B</sub>&cap;M<sub>C</sub>, B'' =
        M<sub>C</sub>&cap;M<sub>A</sub>, C' = M<sub>A</sub>&cap;M<sub>B</sub>.

A''B''C'' is perspective to these: ABC, intouch, hexyl, Yff, and the 1st and 2nd circumperp triangles. A'B'C' is homothetic to A''B''C'', which is perspective to the excentral triangle at X(168).

There exist three congruent squares U, V, W positioned in ABC as
        follows: U has opposing vertices on segments AB and AC; V has opposing
        vertices on segments BC and BA; W has opposing vertices on segments CA
        and CB, and there is a single point common to U, V, W. The common
        point, X(371), may have first been published in Kenmotu's <i>Collection
        of Sangaku Problems</i> in 1840, indicating that its first appearance
        may have been anonymously inscribed on a wooden board hung up in a
        Japanese shrine or temple. (The Kenmotu configuration uses only
        half-squares; i.e., isosceles right triangles). Trilinears were found
        by John Rigby.
</p><p>
The edgelength of the three squares is
        2<sup>1/2</sup>abc/(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> +
        4&sigma;), where &sigma; = area(ABC). (Edward Brisse, 2/12/2000)</p>
	<p>X(371) is the internal center of similitude of the circumcircle and
        the 2nd Lemoine circle (cosine circle) (Peter J. C. Moses, 5/9/03).
        Also, X(371) is the internal center of similitude of the Gallatly
        circle (defined just before X(2007)) and the 1st Lemoine circle (Peter
        J. C. Moses, 9/10/2003).
</p><p>
X(371) is the perspector of several pairs of triangles associated
        with Lucas circles. Some of these triangles are defined at MathWorld;
        e.g. <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LucasCentralTriangle.html" style=
        "font-weight: bold">Lucas Central Triangle</a>, and others are
        Lucas(L:W) configurations. The latter are generalizations of
        configurations associated with Lucas circles, in which the squares are
        replaced by rectangles of length-to-width ratio L:W, with length on the
        corresponding sideline of ABC. A negative ratio indicates that the
        rectangles are directed inward; e.g. Lucas(-1:1) indicates
        inward-directed squares, whereas Lucas(1:1) indicates the classical
        case of outward-directed squares. These generalizations and the
        following properties of X(371) were contributed by Randy Hutson,
        9/23/2011. See also X(372) and X(1084).

X(385) is the perspector of triangle ABC and the tangential triangle
        of the conic that passes through A, B, C, and the pair P(1) and U(1) of
        bicentric points (see the notes just before X(1908). (Randy Hutson,
        9/23/2011)

Let A'B'C' be the 1st Brocard triangle.  Let A" be the trilinear pole of line B'C', and define B" and C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(385).  (Randy Hutson, November 30, 2015)
</p><p>
Let La be the line through A parallel to the Lemoine axis, and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let Ma be the reflection of BC in La, and define Mb and Mc cyclically. 
Let A' = Mb&cap;Mc, and define B', C' cyclically.  Triangle A'B'C' is inversely similar to, and 3 times the size of, ABC.  Let A"B"C" be the reflection of A'B'C' in the Lemoine axis.

In <b>Cosmin Pohoata,</b> "On the Parry reflection point," <i>Forum Geometricorum</i> 8 (2008), 43-48 <a href="http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2008volume8/FG200806.pdf" style= "font-weight: bold">here</a>, the following is proved:
</p><p>
Let A' be the reflection of vertex A in line BC, and define B', C' cyclically. Let A<sub>t</sub>B<sub>t</sub>C<sub>t</sub> be the tangential triangle of ABC. The circumcircles of the triangles A<sub>t</sub>B'C', A'B<sub>t</sub>C', A'B'C<sub>t</sub> concur in X(399). Moreover, the circumcircles of triangles A'B<sub>t</sub>C<sub>t</sub>, A<sub>t</sub>B'C<sub>t</sub>,  A<sub>t</sub>B<sub>t</sub>C' concur in a point Q = X8157), here named the <b>Parry-Pohoata point</b>. Barycentric coordinates for Q, of degree 22 in a,b,c, were found by J. F. Garcia Captit&aacute;n (Hyacinthos #15827, Nov. 19, 2007) and are included in Pohoata's article. Pohoata notes that the point Q lies on the circumcircle of the points X(3), X(4), X(399).
</p><p>
Let I, I<sub>A</sub>, I<sub>B</sub>, I<sub>C</sub>, denote the incenter and excenters of ABC. Lawrence Evans (Hyacinthos #6878) found that the circumcircles of the triangles IA'I<sub>A</sub>, IB'I<sub>B</sub>, IC'<sub>C</sub> concur in X(399).
</p><p>
The Pohoata article includes a proof that the circumcircles of the triangles A'I<sub>B</sub>I<sub>C</sub>, I<sub>A</sub>B'I<sub>C</sub>, I<sub>A</sub>I<sub>B</sub>C' also pass through X(399). Similar results involving the Fermat points, X(13) and X(14), are proved.

In 1997, Yff considered the configuration for the 1st Ajima-Malfatti

In <i>A History of Mathematics,</i> Florian Cajori writes, "H. C.
        Gossard of the University of Oklahoma showed in 1916 that the three
        Euler lines of the triangles formed by the Euler line and the sides,
        taken by twos, of a given triangle, form a triangle . . . perspective
        with the given triangle and having the same Euler line." Let ABC be the
        given triangle and A'B'C' the Gossard triangle - that is, the triangle
        perspective with the given triangle and having the same Euler line. The
        lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(402), named the Gosssard perspector by
        John Conway (1998).</p>
	<p>Actually, X(402) dates back to an article by Christopher Zeeman in
        <i>Wiskundige Opgaven</i> 8 (1899-1902) 305. For details, see Paul
        Yiu's Hyacinthos message #7536 and others with Gossard in the subject
        line. (In ETC, the change of name from Gossard Perspector to
        Zeeman-Gossard Perspector was made on Oct. 15, 2003.) Further details
        are given by Wilson Stothers in Hyacinthos #8383, Oct. 21, 2003.</p>
	<p>Barycentrics for X(402) were received from Paul Yiu (2/20/99); the
        polynomials p and y referred to above are given as

X(403) is centroid of the triangle having vertices X(4), P(4), U(4).  (Regarding the bicentric pair P(4) and U(4), see the notes just before X(1908)). (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)

Let A' be the reflection in BC of the A-vertex of the tangential triangle, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The circumcircles of AB'C', BC'A', and CA'B' concur at the isogonal conjugate of X(403).  Also, X(403) is the perspector of ABC and the reflection of the anticevian triangle of X(4) in the orthic axis (trilinear polar of X(4)).  (Randy Hutson, July 23, 2015)

X(493) is the homothetic center of triangle ABC and the Lucas homothetic triangle; see X(371). Writing t for the ratio L:W at X(371), let L<sub>A</sub> be the line through the intersections, other than A, of the A-Lucas(t) circle and sides CA and AB. Define L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let A' = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and define B' and C' cyclically. Then the triangle A'B'C', here introduced as the Lucas(t) homothetic triangle, is homothetic to triangle ABC. If t = 1, the center of homothety is X(493); for t = -1, it is X(494); for t = 2, it is X(588); and for t = -2, it is X(589). (Randy Hutson, February 9, 2013)

In barycentric coordinates, the line at infinity, L, is the set of points X = x : y : z satisfying x + y + z = 0. The isogonal conjugate of L, given by a^2 y z + b^2 z x + c^2 x y = 0, is the circumcircle (e.g., X(98)-X(112)).
</p><p>
The collection of collinearities reported below for each of the centers on L comprises a family of parallel lines.
</p><p>
Barycentrics x: y : z (and trilinears) for X(30), X(511)-X(526), and many other triangle centers on L, are polynomials in (a,b,c). For example, barycentrics for X(511) are p(a,b,c) : p(b,c,a) : p(c,a,b), where 
</p><p>
p(a,b,c) = a<sup>2</sup>(a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>4</sup> - c<sup>4</sup>).
</p><p>
Such polynomials comprise a family that can be partitioned into two subfamilies: even and odd.  Each subfamily can be generated as linear combination of polynomials in certain bases.  For example, a basis for the even polynomials of degrees 1 to 4 follows:
</p><p>
degree 1: 2a - b - c
<br>
degree 2: 2a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>, 2bc - ca - ab 
<br>
degree 3:  2a<sup>3</sup> - b<sup>3</sup> - c<sup>3</sup>, a<sup>2</sup>b + a<sup>2</sup>c - b<sup>2</sup>c - b<sup>2</sup>c, a<sup>2</sup>b + a<sup>2</sup>c - b<sup>2</sup>c - b<sup>2</sup>c
<br>
degree 4: 2a<sup>4</sup> - b<sup>4</sup> - c<sup>4</sup>, a<sup>3</sup>b + a<sup>3</sup>c - b<sup>3</sup>c - b<sup>3</sup>c, a<sup>3</sup>b + a<sup>3</sup>c - b<sup>3</sup>c - b<sup>3</sup>c, 2b<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>, 2a<sup>2</sup>bc - ab<sup>2</sup>c - abc<sup>2</sup>
</p><p>
A basis for the odd polynomials of degrees 1 to 2 follows:
</p><p>
degree 1: b - c
<br>
degree 2: (b - c)(a + b + c), (b - c)a

	<br>Joe Goggins (Oct. 19, 2005) found trilinears for points in this
        section, using the following notation. Let
        <p>F(13) = a csc(A + &pi;/3) + b csc(B + &pi;/3) + c csc(C +
        &pi;/3)<br>F(14) = a csc(A - &pi;/3) + b csc(B - &pi;/3) + c csc(C - &pi;/3)<br>These are based on trilinears for the isogonic centers, X(13) and
        X(14). In like manner, F(I) is defined for I = 15, 16, 17, 18, 61,
        62.</p>
	<p>Using this notation, we have, for example,<br>X(616) = F(13)/a - 2 csc(A + &pi;/3) : F(13)/b - 2 csc(B + &pi;/3) :
        F(13)/c - 2 csc(C + &pi;/3)<br>X(617) = F(14)/a - 2 csc(A - &pi;/3) : F(14)/b - 2 csc(B - &pi;/3) :
        F(14)/c - 2 csc(C - &pi;/3)</p>
	<p>Trilinears of this sort are given below at X(i)  for these I:

X(650) is the perspector of triangle ABC and the tangential triangle of the Feuerbach hyperbola. (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)
</p><p>
Let T1, T2, T3 denote the intouch, extouch,and incentral triangles. Let T4 be the side triangle of T2 and T3; T5 that of T3 and T1, and T6 that of T1 and T2. Then X(650) is the perspector of triangle ABC and T4, of ABC and T5, and of ABC and T6. (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)
</p><p>
X(650) is the point of intersection of orthic axis, antiorthic axis and Gergonne line, these being the trilinear polars of X(4), X(1) and X(7), respectively.  More generally, X(650) is the intersection of the trilinear polars of every pair of points on the Feuerbach hyperbola.

James Blaikie (1847-1929) proposed the following problem. Let O be any point in the plane of triangle ABC, and let any straight line g through O meet BC in P, CA in Q, AB in R; then, if points P', Q', R' be taken on the line so that
PO = OP', QO = OQ', RO = OR'.  Prove that AP', BQ', CR' concur.
